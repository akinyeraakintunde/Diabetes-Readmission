Predictive Modeling of Hospital Readmission Risk in Diabetic Patients

This project leverages machine learning to predict the risk of hospital readmission within 30 days for diabetic patients. By analyzing patient demographics, medical history, and treatment data, the model aims to identify high-risk individuals, enabling healthcare providers to implement timely interventions and improve patient outcomes.

Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, SHAP
	•	Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)

Key Objectives
	•	Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform raw healthcare data for analysis.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns and correlations within the dataset.
	•	Model Development: Build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict readmission risk.
	•	Model Interpretability: Utilize SHAP to explain model predictions and ensure transparency.

Model Performance

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	0.78	0.75	0.80	0.77
Random Forest	0.82	0.80	0.85	0.82
XGBoost	0.85	0.83	0.88	0.85

Metrics based on a 70-30 train-test split.

Model Interpretability

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to interpret model predictions and identify key features influencing readmission risk:
	•	Number of previous admissions
	•	Age
	•	Type of medication
	•	Time since last discharge
⸻
Visualizations
	•	Feature Importance: Identify most influential features.
	•	Confusion Matrix: Evaluate model classification performance.
	•	ROC Curve: Assess model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
