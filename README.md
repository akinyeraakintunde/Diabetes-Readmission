## Overview

This project demonstrates my proficiency in **data analysis, machine learning, and Python programming** through a practical dataset. It is part of my portfolio for the **Global Talent Visa** application, showcasing technical skills, problem-solving, and the ability to deliver a full data-driven solution.

The project is fully reproducible, with zero extra setup required, and is tailored to run on **Kaggle** or any local Python environment.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

1. Explore and clean the dataset.  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
3. Build predictive machine learning models.  
4. Evaluate model performance and present actionable insights.  
5. Demonstrate best practices in reproducible data science workflows.

## Dataset

The project uses a **Kaggle dataset**:

- [Dataset Name & Link](#)  

Key features:

- Number of rows: `X`  
- Number of columns: `Y`  
- Target variable: `Z`  

> The dataset is clean and well-structured, allowing for comprehensive analysis and model building.

## Technologies & Libraries

This project is built using **Python 3.11** and the following libraries:

- `pandas` – data manipulation  
- `numpy` – numerical computations  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization  
- `scikit-learn` – machine learning models  
- `jupyter` – interactive coding environment
